## 1. Description  

This project is about estimating users car value on market. Project startet with my interest in BMW 140i.
The point is that the prices where not consistant so it was really hard to estimate its market value. I came up with idea to reagularly scrape car advertising portal and make database out of scraped soup.
I started scraping with beautifullSoup everything was recorded regularly to SQLite database. Every offer came with its own id so every record in DB stayed unique.
I used to collect that data for some time and than I wanted to connect that topic with my Big Data university project. I had and idea to estimate regullar user's car value so it will be easier to post and sell it.
I implemented some machine learning techniques I learned on courses and other projects. This is what came out of it.
